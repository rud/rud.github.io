Working effectively with Ruby on Rails requires a firm understanding of the Ruby language and the full web of associated technologies. I finished my **M.Sc. in Computer Science** at Aarhus University in 2004, and my knowledge of both the tools and platform allow me to create **simple and efficient solutions**, typically in Ruby on Rails.

## Diverse Ruby experience

My first use of Ruby was for an evolutionary algorithm project in '06, simply beacuse the language was easy to use and beautiful. I have since then created many commercial solutions in plain Ruby, including such diverse things as:

 * Generate intuitive graphs of threads and locks from Java crash-dumps for quick root-cause analysis.
 * A tool for verifying of the different paths a request can take through a three-tier web-architecture.
 * Distributed analysis of configuration files from hundreds of servers and creating the big overview of versions and applications.

## Considering Ruby on Rails?

If you consider using Ruby on Rails for your next web application, let me help you get an overview of the possibilities, and let us build an awesome solution together.
